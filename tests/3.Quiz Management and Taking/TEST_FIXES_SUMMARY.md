# Quiz Management and Taking Tests - Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to align the tests in `3.Quiz Management and Taking` with the TEST_PLAN.md specifications.

## Fixed Tests

### Test 3.5: Start Taking a Quiz (05-start-taking-a-quiz.spec.ts)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Changed from `test.fixme()` to `test()`

**Changes Made**:
1. **Removed `test.fixme()` wrapper**: The test was previously marked as skipped with a FIXME comment about registration issues. The test now runs normally.

2. **Improved registration/login flow**: 
   - Added `waitForTimeout(2000)` after registration to allow processing
   - Always navigates to login page explicitly
   - More robust URL waiting with `/\/(dashboard|profile)/` pattern

3. **Added `networkidle` wait**: Added `await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')` after navigating to quizzes page to ensure page is fully loaded before interactions

4. **More precise quiz selection**: 
   - Explicitly looks for "Physics MCQ past papers" quiz heading as specified in test plan
   - Uses `page.locator('a[href*="/quizzes/"][href*="/take"]').first()` for reliable link clicking

5. **Enhanced assertions**:
   - Specifically checks for "Physics MCQ past papers" heading
   - Verifies timer format: "Time Left: 05:00" (matches 5-minute limit from test plan)
   - Confirms question counter shows "Question 1 of 3" (specific to Physics quiz)
   - Validates Previous button is disabled and Next button is enabled

**Test Plan Alignment**:
- ✅ Navigate to /quizzes
- ✅ Locate "Physics MCQ past papers" quiz (specific quiz mentioned in test plan)
- ✅ Click "Start Quiz" button
- ✅ Verify redirect to /quizzes/[quizId]/take
- ✅ Verify quiz title "Physics MCQ past papers" displayed
- ✅ Verify timer showing "Time Left: 05:00" (5-minute limit)
- ✅ Verify question counter "Question 1 of 3"
- ✅ Verify question text displayed
- ✅ Verify answer options as buttons
- ✅ Verify Previous button (disabled on question 1)
- ✅ Verify Next button (enabled)

**Expected Test Data**: 
- Quiz: "Physics MCQ past papers"
- Subject: Physics
- Difficulty: Hard
- Questions: 3
- Time Limit: 5 minutes

## Tests Status Summary

### Aligned with Test Plan
- ✅ **Test 3.5**: Start Taking a Quiz - Now properly tests the Physics MCQ quiz with all expected verifications

### Tests 3.6-3.11: Quiz Taking and Results (06-11-*.spec.ts)
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Updated Start Quiz locators and Answer Button Selection

**Changes Made**:
1. **Fixed Start Quiz locator**: Changed from `page.getByRole('link', { name: /Start Quiz/i })` to `page.locator('a[href*="/quizzes/"][href*="/take"]')` to match the actual DOM structure

2. **Added `networkidle` wait**: Added `await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')` after navigating to quizzes page to ensure page is fully loaded before interactions

3. **Fixed Answer Button Selection**: Updated answer button locators to be more specific and exclude navigation buttons:
   - Changed from broad regex patterns to more specific ones
   - Used negative lookahead to exclude "Previous", "Next", "Submit", "Finish" buttons
   - Used `page.getByRole('button')` instead of `page.locator('button')` for better accessibility
   - Added visibility checks before clicking

4. **Fixed Results Page Assertions**: Updated test 08 to use specific locators instead of ambiguous regex patterns:
   - Changed `page.getByText(/Score|Result|Points/i)` to `page.getByRole('heading', { name: /Quiz Results/i })`
   - Added specific checks for "Your Score", score format, and percentage display

**Test Plan Alignment**:
- ✅ All tests now properly navigate to quizzes page and start a quiz
- ✅ Tests 3.6-3.11 can now access quiz taking functionality
- ✅ Answer button selection works correctly without clicking navigation buttons
- ✅ Results page verification works with specific, unambiguous locators
- ✅ Locator matches the actual link structure in the application

## Tests Status Summary

### Aligned with Test Plan
- ✅ **Test 3.5**: Start Taking a Quiz - Fixed locator and timing issues
- ✅ **Tests 3.6-3.11**: Quiz Taking and Results - Fixed Start Quiz locators, answer button selection, and results page assertions

### Needs Review (Not Modified)
- ⚠️ **Test 3.1**: Browse Available Quizzes - Uses `[data-testid="quiz-card"]` which may not exist
- ⚠️ **Test 3.2**: Filter Quizzes by Subject - Uses `[data-testid="quiz-card"]` which may not exist
- ⚠️ **Test 3.3**: Filter Quizzes by Difficulty - Uses `[data-testid="quiz-card"]` which may not exist  
- ⚠️ **Test 3.4**: Clear Quiz Filters - Uses simpler selectors, may work

---

## Recommendations

### For Tests 3.1-3.4 (Quiz Browsing and Filtering)
The tests use `[data-testid="quiz-card"]` selector which doesn't appear to exist in the actual DOM. They should be updated to use:
- Heading elements for quiz titles
- Link elements with `href` containing "/quizzes/" and "/take"
- Text content matching for subjects and difficulties

### For Tests 3.6-3.11 (Quiz Taking and Results)
These tests should be reviewed to ensure they:
1. Use proper waits (`networkidle`, `waitForLoadState`)
2. Have robust selectors that match the actual DOM structure
3. Handle edge cases (no quizzes available, registration failures, etc.)
4. Align with specific examples from test plan where applicable

---

## Test Execution Notes

- Tests may experience timing issues without `networkidle` waits
- Registration might fail if backend is not running, but tests should handle this gracefully
- Some tests might need to skip if no test data is available (no quizzes seeded)
